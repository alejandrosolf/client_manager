# Client Manager

## Overview

This Python application serves as a client manager, allowing users to manage client information using both a command-line interface (CLI) and a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter. 
The client data is stored in a CSV (Comma Separated Values) database.

## Features

- **CSV Database:** Client information is stored in a CSV file (`clients.csv`) for easy data management and persistence.
- **Terminal Mode:** Provides a command-line interface for users who prefer working in a terminal or command prompt.
- **UI Mode:** Includes a graphical user interface using Tkinter for a more user-friendly interaction.
